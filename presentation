Good Morning/Afternoon everybody.  My name is Brad Goldsmith, this is Willis Dorden, and Jose Velez
	and we are team GetOutandGo and this is our project (load up the html file!!!!!)

All three of us try to be healthy and live active lifestyles and have noticed it to be cumbersome 
	when on a vacation or just out for the day.  Let's be honest here I don't know about you all but
	I don't actually get much vacation time from work so a day off is a vaction to me.
	And this is where our website/application comes into play.  
	We've made it a bit easier to find a fun outdoor activity or just a way to enjoy the great outdoors.

(I feel like that takes care of Lisa's pdf file description/motivation/results)

Team Efforts:
	Brad work mainly on the front end while Willis and Jose did the back end.
		*We also all jumped in were needed and made sure to help each other out if any problems arose(
			which seemed to happen all to often).
***********************
Here we can each go into detail about our contributions
I'll type mine up and you all do the same for yours and we just have to kinda memorize them I guess, 
	since I don't think we can or should read off the screen the entire time.   But a good outline can't
	hurt.

Brad -	I built the majority of the front end with input from both Jose and Willis.  We chose to use the
		materialize framework, one because it's kinda cool, and two because it's a new technology that we 
		haven't used so it was a good requirement for our project.  
		We also decided to build from scratch instead of using a template because well even though it was a little
			harder it met the requirements and let us put our own touches on it.  
		So as you can see our home page is rather basic.  The top nav-bar has a home and recent search links that
			will stay with us throughout the page, as well as a sticky footer that has our team name.  
		We used google autocomplete in our seach bar to help the user make an easier input choice plus it also 
			looks cool and is kinda badass.  
		When you click on explore that's when all the magic happens and I'll hand it over to Willis and Jose and 
			they can take it from there.
Willis - backend production(trailAPI, wundergroundAPI)
Jose - backend/fontend production(googleMaps API/Geocoding)
Brad - Fill in when needed, as well as Willis/Jose

Problems we faced:
	We found it rather difficult to actually "pick out an idea"
	We also found github rather difficult as far as the branching/merging goes, mainly because we didn't
		want to accidentially delete our information.  Towards the end it was easier but since we all were
		helping out where needed it made some of the merging more difficult than expected.
	Our schedules also just suck since we are all opposite so we couldn't really meet outside of class and 
		even though we all were working we found that working together was a tad more productive for our 
		overall group progess.
	We also found that even though the travelAPI is rather cool and unique, it is not near as full as we hoped.

Future of our Project:
	We hope to work with travelAPI and google to help them fill out more of their API, that way more results will 
		be shown.  I mean if you type in Denver, CO you get 10 results where there are probably 100+ in that area, 
		but again that is the future.  
	We would also like to add a User Feedback area when someone who actually hiked the trail or camped out can rate
		it and let others know what they think.  It would also be really cool if we could have a section too where the user can input a specific trail/campsite that is not listed and we could take that information and pass it 
		along to the API so it can be added.  
	We also want to build out a GPS implentation so that when you click on the trail it gives you turn by turn 
		directions to the trail from your location.
