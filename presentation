Hello everybody, My name is Brad Goldsmith, this is Willis Dorden and that is Jose Velez, and we are:
Team GetOutandGo.
All of us try to be healthy and live active lifestyles and we've found this somewhat tough when visiting a new area, 
	weather for work or just a personal vacation.
We wanted a way of staying active (and we wanted more than local gyms)
	and I'm not a runner so running is just out of the question.
With our application we have made it easier to find ways to enjoy the great outdoors.  
When you come to our homepage you'll see a very lovely background image of the great outdoors,
	a link to our homepage on the top left and a link to recent searches on the top right.  Those are done
	through materialize framework.  I did the majority of the front end while Willis and Jose worked on the backend.  
	And as any good group we all helped out where needed.

---Here we'll type in a city and run the site
---Willis takes over explaining his work on the weather/carousel
---Jose talks about his recent searches and storing them in firebase/putting them in the navbar
---Rotating background images:
	Used a new tool called JqueryCycle, which has defualt animations and let's you set a timer for fading in/out.  

We found trailAPI through travel searches and found it to be the best available API for hiking trails, mountain bike 
	trails, and camping sites.  So basically on the main page you'll see our seach bar and you enter a city/state and we take that data and show you whats near you.  We went with the google auotocomplete to make searching a tad easier.  We manipulated that "input" data so we could send out the city/state information to various APIs so that we could plenish our results page.  
One thing that we did notice throughout this project is that as useful as the trailAPI is, it is limited.  We are 	
	hoping to contact and work with them in the future to help them fill out more results.  We also eventually plan to put in user feedback so that someone that actually used this website and actually hiked the trail can give their feedback on the trail.  This will hopefully also allow for helping us build up their API with more photos and information about trails/camp sites.  
Also we were wanting to add GPS locations for all of the trail so you could see them on the map but we ran out of 
	time.  Again in the future we would love for when you click on the trail it pins the location on the maps, then there will be a button for "Get Directions"  Click on that and you enter your address and based on googlesAPI we could give you turn by turn directions for this desination, which would be more useful for the mobile version becuase let's be honest most people don't print directions anymore then just use their phones.
